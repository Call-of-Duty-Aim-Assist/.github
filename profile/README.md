* Custom hotkeys (default: `CapsLock` toggle)

### 🧠 FOV Lock Control

* FOV scaling between 10°–180°
* Dynamic field adjustment for ADS vs. hipfire
* Multi-weapon memory zones for instant switching

### 🪶 Movement Compensation

* Bullet drop & recoil alignment per weapon type
* Motion prediction using real-time network latency
* Adjustable response curves for different sensitivities

### 🧩 Configs & Profiles

* Save/load `.cfg` setups for different playstyles
* Import others’ profiles for fast optimization
* Preset modes: *Stealth Assist*, *Sniper Sync*, *Aggro Lock*

> [!NOTE]
> Each preset is optimized for unique engagement styles — sniper configs maintain long-range precision, while aggressive setups prioritize close-range tracking.
